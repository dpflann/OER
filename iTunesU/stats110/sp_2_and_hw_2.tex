\subsection{Inclusion-Exclusion}	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For 7 people, what is the probability that all 4 season occur at least once among their birthdays assuming all seasons are equally likely.
			$A_i$ is the probability that there are no birthdays in the $i^{th}$ season. Probability that all seasons occur at least once is $1 - P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4)$.
			$A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4 = \emptyset$
			\[
				P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4) = \sum_{i}^{4}P(A_i) - \sum_{i=1}^{3}\sum_{j > i}P(A_i \cap A_j) + \sum_{i=1}^{3}\sum_{j>i}\sum_{k>j}P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k)
			\]
			\[
				= 4P(A_1) - 6P(A_1 \cap A_2) + 4P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3)
			\]
			$P(A_1) = (3 / 4)^{7}$,
			$P(A_1 \cap A_2) = \frac{1}{2^{7}}$,
			$P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3) = \frac{1}{4^{7}}$
			\[
				P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4)  = 4(\frac{3}{4^{7}}) - 6(\frac{1}{2^{7}}) + 4(\frac{1}{4^{7}})
			\]
			\[
				\rightarrow 1 - [4(\frac{3}{4^{7}}) - 6(\frac{1}{2^{7}}) + 4(\frac{1}{4^{7}})]
			\]
			The probability that there are no birthdays in all the season is the $\emptyset$. The probability that there are no birthdays in a given season means you have reduced the number of season by 1,
			there are now 3 seasons to choose from. And so on for 2 seasons not occurring, and so on for 3 seasons not occurring. Each time you are making the event less probable by shrinking the number of options.
		\item Picking Classes Randomly
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Naive: There are 7 classes to take total, there are 30 total classes, 6 each day of the week. 7 classes can be taken either with 2 days with 2 classes and 3 days with 1 or 1 day with 3 classes and 4 days with 1:
					(2, 2, 1, 1, 1) or (3, 1, 1, 1, 1). First select the days of the week that will have more than one course, then for those days select the required number out of the 6 possible classes, then for the remaining days, select
					1 of the possible 6 classes.
					\[
						\frac{\binom{5}{2}\binom{6}{2}\binom{6}{2}\binom{6}{1}\binom{6}{1}\binom{6}{1} + \binom{5}{1}\binom{6}{3}\binom{6}{1}\binom{6}{1}\binom{6}{1}\binom{6}{1}}{\binom{30}{7}}
					\]
